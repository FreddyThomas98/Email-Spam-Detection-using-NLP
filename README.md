Email Spam Detection using NLP is a machine learning project aimed at developing a robust system for automatically categorizing emails as spam or non-spam (ham). Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the system analyzes the content of emails to extract relevant features such as word frequency, presence of specific keywords, and text patterns indicative of spam. These features are then used to train a classification model, employing algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), or deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers.

The project provides an end-to-end solution for efficient email filtering, ensuring that users receive only relevant and legitimate emails in their inbox while effectively identifying and filtering out spam messages. This project aims to contribute to enhancing email security and user experience by automating the process of spam detection, reducing the risk of phishing attacks and improving productivity by minimizing the time spent sorting through unwanted emails.
